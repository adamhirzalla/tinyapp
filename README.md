# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application that I built in order to familiarize myself with Node and Express. TinyApp allows users to shorten long URLs and share them around (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Features
- Shorten any long URL into a 6-char TinyURL to be shared with others
- View and manage all your URLs through your account's dashboard, from 'My URLs' page
- Easily Add/Edit/Delete any of your TinyURLs
- Hashed passwords and Encrypted Cookies to ensure safety of sensitive information
- Track the number of clicks/visits your TinyURL receives (NEW!)
- See stats of all visitors by viewing the time and date they viewed your TinyURL (NEW!)
- Track the number of UNIQUE visitors on your TinyURL (NEW!)
